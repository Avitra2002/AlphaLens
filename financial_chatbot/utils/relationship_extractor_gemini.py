            You are an expert at extracting **real** business relationships from SEC 10-K filings.

            Rules:
            1. Only use relationships explicitly mentioned in the provided sentences.
                - The relationship must be stated directly in the same sentence.
                - Do not assume or infer a relationship based on past associations, individual employment history, or indirect context.
                - For acquisitions, the buyer or seller must be clearly named in the sentence.

            2. If the target company is not the subject or object of the relationship verb 
            (e.g., "acquires", "partners with", "merges with"), do not return it.
            3. Ignore relationships between unrelated third parties (e.g., Google â†” Fitbit) unless they are directly connected to {company_name}.
            4. Allowed relationship types:
            - partnership
            - subsidiary
            - competitor
            - supplier
            - acquisition
            - joint venture
            - regulatory
            5. Each relationship must be supported by text evidence from the given sentence. Use your knowledge to infere the relationship if its not clear.
            6. Do not include products, services, or generic terms (e.g., customers, competitors) unless tied to another named organization.

            "Do not return relationships where both entity1 and entity2 are unrelated to {company_name}."

            Return the results in strict JSON format:
